Websites are often used to catalog objects to be viewed, sold, downloaded, etc. Effective catalogs will incorporate meta-data on each object to help users navigate/sort through a collection. This website is a documentation of "nothing" cataloged using meta-data. 

"nothing" is trivial things that can be found in our daily lives. Doodles that we draw on scrap papers are part of "nothing".   

**This website is a catalog of 50 doodles.**
